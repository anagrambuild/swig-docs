The Swig TypeScript SDK provides a robust interface for interacting with Solana smart contracts and wallets. Built on top of the Web3.js 1.0 line of Solana SDK, it offers developers a streamlined experience for building decentralized applications on Solana.

## Architecture Overview

The v1.0 SDK has been completely refactored with a modular architecture:

- **`@swig-wallet/coder`** - Low-level encoding/decoding utilities
- **`@swig-wallet/lib`** - Core functionality
- **`@swig-wallet/classic`** - High-level wrapper functions for Web3.js 1.x compatibility
- **`@swig-wallet/kit`** - High-level wrapper functions for Web3.js 2.0 (Solana Kit) compatibility

## API Reference

The canonical source for the Swig TypeScript SDK API documentation can be found at:
[https://anagrambuild.github.io/swig-ts/modules.html](https://anagrambuild.github.io/swig-ts/modules.html)

### Key Packages

#### `@swig-wallet/classic`

For Web3.js 1.x applications, providing:

- Instruction builders returning `TransactionInstruction[]`
- Account fetching utilities using `Connection`
- PDA derivation functions (synchronous)
- Re-exports of core functionality from `@swig-wallet/lib`

#### `@swig-wallet/kit`

For Web3.js 2.0 (Solana Kit) applications, providing:

- Instruction builders returning `KitInstruction[]`
- Account fetching utilities using `Rpc<GetAccountInfoApi>`
- PDA derivation functions (asynchronous)
- Same API surface as classic but with Web3.js 2.0 types

#### `@swig-wallet/lib`

Core logic including:

- `Actions` class for permission management
- `Swig` class for wallet representation
- Authority management utilities
- Instruction context builders

#### `@swig-wallet/coder`

Low-level utilities for:

- Account data encoding/decoding
- Instruction data serialization
- Type definitions

## Migration from Beta Versions

**Breaking Changes in v1.0:**

- Complete API restructure - most function signatures have changed
- Functions now return `TransactionInstruction[]` instead of single instructions
- Authority and Actions classes moved to `@swig-wallet/lib`
- New dependency on `@solana-program/token` instead of `@solana/spl-token`

## Web3.js Version Support

The Swig SDK supports both major versions of the Solana Web3.js library:

### Web3.js 1.x (`@swig-wallet/classic`)

- Uses `Connection`, `PublicKey`, `TransactionInstruction`
- Synchronous PDA derivation
- Compatible with existing Web3.js 1.x applications
- Stable and production-ready

### Web3.js 2.0 (`@swig-wallet/kit`)

- Uses `Rpc`, `Address`, `KitInstruction`
- Asynchronous PDA derivation
- Built for the new Solana Kit architecture
- Future-ready with enhanced type safety

## Future Development

We are actively working on expanding the SDK's capabilities. Upcoming features include:

- Enhanced session management
- Additional authority types
- Integration with Gill
- Performance optimizations

These additions will provide developers with even more flexibility and enhanced capabilities for building on Solana.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to evolve the SDK to meet the growing needs of the Solana development community.
