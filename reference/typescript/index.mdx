The Swig TypeScript SDK provides a robust interface for interacting with Solana smart contracts and wallets.Built on top of the Web3.js 1.0 line of Solana SDK, it offers developers a streamlined experience for building decentralized applications on Solana.

## API Reference

The canonical source for the Swig TypeScript SDK API documentation can be found at:
[https://anagrambuild.github.io/swig-ts/modules.html](https://anagrambuild.github.io/swig-ts/modules.html)

  This comprehensive reference includes detailed documentation for all modules, including:
    - `@swig-wallet/classic`
      - `@swig-wallet/coder`

## Future Development

We are actively working on expanding the SDK's capabilities. Upcoming features include:
  - Support for Web3.js 2.0
    - Integration with Gill

These additions will provide developers with even more flexibility and enhanced capabilities for building on Solana.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to evolve the SDK to meet the growing needs of the Solana development community.
