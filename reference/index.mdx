# SWIG SDKs: TypeScript and Rust

SWIG provides powerful SDKs in both TypeScript and Rust, each optimized for different use cases in the blockchain development ecosystem. Let's explore how these SDKs can enhance your development experience.

## TypeScript SDK

The TypeScript SDK is specifically designed for frontend applications and wallet integrations. It excels in:

- **Wallet Integration**: Seamlessly connect with web-based wallets and handle user interactions
- **Frontend Development**: Build responsive and interactive dApp interfaces
- **Browser Compatibility**: Optimized for web environments and modern browsers
- **User Experience**: Provides smooth, asynchronous operations for blockchain interactions

Perfect for:
- Web-based dApps
- Wallet interfaces
- User-facing blockchain applications
- Interactive frontend experiences

## Rust SDK

The Rust SDK is engineered for high-performance backend applications and command-line tools. Its strengths include:

- **Server Applications**: Build robust backend services with native performance
- **CLI Tools**: Create powerful command-line interfaces for blockchain interactions
- **Performance**: Leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety
- **System Integration**: Deep integration with system-level resources

Ideal for:
- Backend services
- Command-line tools
- High-performance applications
- System-level blockchain integration

## Choosing the Right SDK

When building your blockchain application:

- Choose the **TypeScript SDK** when you need to:
  - Build user interfaces
  - Integrate with web wallets
  - Create frontend applications
  - Handle user interactions

- Choose the **Rust SDK** when you need to:
  - Develop backend services
  - Create CLI tools
  - Optimize for performance
  - Build system-level applications

Both SDKs provide comprehensive tooling for blockchain development, allowing you to choose the best tool for your specific use case while maintaining full compatibility with the SWIG ecosystem.
