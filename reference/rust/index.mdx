The Rust SDK is a powerful toolkit designed for backend use cases, providing developers with robust tools for blockchain interaction and wallet management. The SDK is built on three main pillars:

## Instruction Builder

The Instruction Builder is a core component that helps developers construct and manage blockchain instructions. It provides a type-safe and intuitive way to build transaction instructions, making it easier to interact with the blockchain while maintaining security and reliability.

Key features:
- Type-safe instruction building
- Transaction composition
- Built-in validation

## Swig Rust Wallet

The Swig Rust Wallet component provides comprehensive wallet management capabilities. It handles key management, transaction signing, and account operations with a focus on security and performance.

Key features:
- Secure key management
- Transaction signing
- Account operations
- Balance tracking

## Swig CLI

The Swig CLI is a command-line interface tool that provides direct access to wallet functionality from the terminal. It's built on top of the Rust SDK and offers a convenient way to interact with the blockchain for testing, development, and automation purposes.

Key features:
- Command-line wallet management
- Transaction creation and signing
- Account information retrieval
- Network interaction utilities

## Code References

The SDK's source code can be found in the following locations:

## Getting Started

To start using the Rust SDK, you'll need to add it as a dependency to your Rust project. The SDK provides a modular architecture allowing you to use only the components you need for your specific use case.

For detailed implementation examples and API documentation, please refer to the individual component documentation linked above.
