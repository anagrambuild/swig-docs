Swig is built for developers. Our smart wallet tooling is allowing developers to quickly unlock both fundamental and advanced functionality for their end-users. We’re early, but we’re already powering a diverse set of use cases across payments, dApps, AI, cross-chain, and many more.

## **Payments**

Why build your payments use case on Swig:

- **Subscriptions:** Enable automatic, on-chain subscription payments that are configurable to your required payment cadence.
- **Pre-Set Spending Conditions:** Ensure that your users never get charged more than the amounts they expect to get charged.
- **Payment Streaming:** Enable micropayment streams of any kind.
- **Payment Speed:** Authorize transactions in <800 milliseconds with Swig.
- **Configurable Payment Holds:** Allows you to configure settlement times on card payments based on your card’s needs. Set settlements to be real-time, on hold for 24 hours, or any other amount of time - whatever is required for your use case.

## **dApps**

Why build your dApp on Swig:

- **Granular Permissions:** Enables users to give your app specific permissions without giving you access to their whole wallet, which allows you to create more powerful experiences for your users with the permissions granted to the app while staying non-custodial.
- **Configurable & Automatic Transactions:** Powers functionality like automatic trading strategies, conditional transactions based on chain events, dollar-cost averaging, continuous transactions, and much more.
- **Session Keys:** Allows users to just approve once during a defined time period while using your app. Avoids the UX frictions of constant manual signing.
- **Gasless Transactions:** Integrate Swig’s paymaster to eliminate UX friction by covering gas fees for your users or enable them to pay gas fees with non-native tokens.
- **Social Sign In & Recovery:** Onboard non-crypto and crypto-native users without frictions associated with traditional wallet onboarding and seed recovery concerns.
- **Chain Abstraction:** Enables your app to operate across multiple SVM chains without UX frictions since users can operate across SVM chains with one Swig wallet.

## **AI**

Why build your AI use case on Swig:

- **AI Chat:** Easily create AI-powered chat-to-action functionality within your app that enables users conduct transactions in your app experience via a chat function. Users can type things like “buy 10 SOL next time the price drops below $100” and your app handles the rest with Swig.
- **AI Swarms:** Use Swig’s role-based permissions architecture to enable AI swarm use cases for any app type. With Swig, you can configure multiple agents to each have different permissions and have them work together based on conditional logic.
- **Frictionless AI:** Leveraging session keys, agents can seamlessly execute several transactions within a defined period without needing to stop for constant approvals.
- **Much More…** the functionality that Swig offers on-chain agents can power an endless possibility of features. We encourage builders to get creative and let us know what you were able to build on Swig.

## **Cross-Chain**

Why “add Solana” to your app using Swig:

- **Sign SVM Transactions With EVM Keys:** Building on Swig allows your users to sign SVM transactions during their app experience without needing to leave their EVM wallet. This allows your app and your users to benefit from the power of Solana without creating any UX friction.
- **“Add Solana”:** For apps that are expanding their chain support to Solana, building their Solana use case on Swig from the start has allowed them to ensure the most robust Solana experience for their users while avoiding development headaches that come with working on an unfamiliar chain. Our docs can be exported as an MCP server so that non-Solana native developers can easily understand Swig and build powerful Solana use cases for their users.
- **UX Parity Across Chains:** If your app is multi-chain, you are likely using EVM smart wallet tools to power advanced experiences for your users when they interact with EVM protocols. But until now, you haven’t been able to provide them with experience parity when they interact with SVM protocols in your app. With Swig’s smart wallet functionality, you can close that parity gap to ensure your users have universal experiences across EVM and SVM chains.

## **And more…**

Swig’s primitives allow for an endless number of possibilities across any use case. In addition to payments, dApps, AI, and cross-chain use cases, Swig can power use cases such as custodians adding hot wallet functionality to their custody stack, exchanges building unique on-chain trading experiences, gaming apps reducing in-game UX frictions, and many more.

**We believe some of the most powerful use cases built on Swig have not even been imagined yet. If you are a developer and are interested in building something new on Solana, we encourage you to play around on Swig and see what Swig can enable you to create.**
