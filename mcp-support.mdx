## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that connects your functions to LLMs and AI applications. With Mintlify's integration, you can automatically generate an MCP server for Swig's docs, enabling seamless AI-powered interactions with your product.

## Generating your MCP server

Swig docs can be converted into an MCP server using the following command:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add build.onswig.com
```

You can also view an llms-full.txt file [here](https://build.onswig.com/llms-full.txt)
