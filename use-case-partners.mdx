Swig’s smart wallet tooling helps embedded wallets, wallets, SVM L2s, and other partners better service their ecosystem of developers, which in turn helps them build better use cases for their users.

## **Wallets & Embedded Wallets**

Swig is a great fit as a partner to wallets & embedded wallets to help solve the needs of their developers:

- **Add Solana Smart Wallet Tooling:** Expose SVM smart wallet tooling to your ecosystem of developers building on your embedded wallet so that your platform continues to be where they build across multiple chains.
- **Custom Auth Flows:** Build custom authentication flows by combining Swig’s wallet SDK with your embedded wallet for your developers to leverage as they build.
- **Additional Auth Types:** For MPC wallets, your developers can use your wallet and leverage multiple different auth types beyond just MPC when combined with Swig.
- **Much More…** the functionality that Swig offers combined with your wallet can provide boundless benefits to developers and allow you to grow your ecosystem.

Let’s work together to empower developers building Solana use cases.

## **SVM L2s**

Swig can help SVM L2s build a robust ecosystem:

- **Build Better Apps:** Swig’s smart wallet functionality combined with the benefits of SVM offer developers with the tooling to create the most compelling apps. Ensuring your ecosystem of developers are building on Swig will set your chain up well for user adoption growth as users will be drawn to apps that have the advanced functionality that building on Swig can create.
- **Reduce Onboarding Frictions:** Swig’s cross-chain functionality enables developers to build apps that operate across multiple SVM chains without UX frictions since users can operate across SVM chains with one Swig wallet. This means that developers building on Swig will have an easier time bringing users to your chain.

Let’s work together to bring adoption to your chain.

## **And more…**

Swig’s primitives allow for an endless number of possibilities across any use case. We are powering use cases across payments, dApps, AI, cross-chain, custodians, exchanges, gaming apps and more. If you are looking to grow your ecosystems of developers and users, it’s very likely that partnering with Swig can help accelerate that.
