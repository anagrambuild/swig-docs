## How It Works

SWIG can handle both debit and credit card flows in a way that's both elegant and compliant. Our authority system forms the foundation, giving you complete control over who can spend what and when, while our authorization locks enable sophisticated payment flows that traditional finance demands.

### Debit Card Processing
When it comes to debit cards, things are pretty straightforward. Using our standard spending limits, you can pull funds directly into your treasury account. Think of it as an instant transfer – the money moves right away, and you can start using it immediately. Our authority system ensures that only authorized parties can initiate these transfers, and you can set custom limits that make sense for your business.

### Credit Card Magic
Credit cards are where things get interesting. Instead of immediately pulling funds, our authorization locks system lets you place a hold on the funds first. This is perfect for situations where you need to verify a card's validity and ensure funds are available, but aren't ready to complete the transaction yet. The authorization lock is incredibly fast and cost-effective, and it keeps the funds reserved until the credit card provider is ready to process the payment according to their jurisdiction's rules and requirements.

This approach is particularly valuable in industries with complex payment flows. For example, if you're running a car rental service, you can authorize a security deposit without actually charging it, then only capture the final amount once the rental period is complete. Hotels, travel companies, and any business dealing with delayed or variable charges will find this especially useful.
