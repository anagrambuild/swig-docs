# Building Subscription Services with SWIG

SWIG's token limit feature provides a powerful way to implement subscription-based services on Solana. This guide demonstrates how to create a subscription service that charges users monthly using SWIG's token limit capabilities.

You can find the complete example code in the [swig-ts/examples/subscriptions.ts](https://github.com/anagrambuild/swig-ts/tree/main/examples/transfer/subscription-svm.ts) file.
<Tip>
Examples with svm in the file name use LiteSVM for testing. Those without svm in the file name use a local validator. Which you can run with the `bun start-validator` command.</Tip>
## Overview

In this example, we'll create a subscription service that:
- Charges users $10 USDC monthly
- Uses SWIG's token limit feature to enforce the subscription amount and period
- Demonstrates how the limit resets after the specified period

## Key Concepts

### Token Limits

SWIG's token limit feature allows you to:
- Set a maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred within a specified block period
- Automatically reset the limit after the period expires
- Track limits per token mint (supporting multiple tokens)

### Block Period

In this example, we use a block period of 216,000 blocks, which approximates one month given Solana's average block time of 400ms:
```typescript
// 400ms per block
// 1 month ≈ 30 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds * (1/0.4) blocks/second
// ≈ 216,000 blocks
```

## Implementation

The example demonstrates:
1. Creating a SWIG wallet with root authority
2. Setting up a subscription service authority with token limits
3. Processing subscription paymentsI
4. Handling period resets

Here's a key snippet showing how to set up the subscription authority:

```typescript
let subscriptionActions = Actions.set()
  .tokenLimit({
    mint: usdcMint,
    amount: BigInt(10_000_000), // $10 with 6 decimals
    blocks: 216000, // ~1 month at 400ms per block
  })
  .get();

let addSubscriptionAuthorityIx = await addAuthorityInstruction(
  rootRole,
  rootKeypair.publicKey,
  createEd25519AuthorityInfo(subscriptionServiceKeypair.publicKey),
  subscriptionActions,
);
```

## Use Cases

This pattern enables various subscription-based services:

1. **SaaS Applications**
   - Monthly software subscriptions
   - Tiered service plans
   - Usage-based billing

2. **Content Platforms**
   - Premium content access
   - Streaming services
   - Digital publication subscriptions

3. **Gaming Services**
   - Monthly game passes
   - Premium features access
   - In-game subscription benefits

4. **DeFi Services**
   - Trading fee subscriptions
   - Premium analytics access
   - Automated trading services

## Complete Example

For a complete working example that includes both client and server implementations, check out the [SWIG SDK Example Repository](https://github.com/anagrambuild/swig-rs-sdk-example). This repository demonstrates:

- Frontend subscription management
- Backend subscription processing
- Error handling and edge cases
- User management integration

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Always verify transaction success
   - Handle failed payments gracefully
   - Implement retry mechanisms

2. **User Experience**
   - Notify users before renewal
   - Provide clear subscription status
   - Implement grace periods

3. **Security**
   - Secure key management
   - Rate limiting
   - Transaction monitoring
