This guide covers how to invite team members, manage roles, and handle permissions in your Swig project.

## Member Roles

Swig uses role-based access control with four distinct roles:

| Role | Access Level | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full | Complete control including billing, members, and ownership transfer |
| **Admin** | High | Can manage members and most settings (except other owners) |
| **Member** | Standard | Access to project resources (API keys, policies, paymasters) |
| **Billing** | Limited | View and manage billing only |

### Role Hierarchy

```
Owner (100)
  └── Admin (75)
        └── Member (50)

Billing (25) - Special role, isolated permissions
```

### Permission Matrix

3. Confirm your departure

**Restrictions:**

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

- **Owners**: Key decision-makers, founders, CTOs
- **Admins**: Team leads, project managers
- **Members**: Developers, engineers
- **Billing**: Finance team, accountants

### Security

- Regularly audit member access
- Remove members who leave the team
- Use the minimum role necessary
- Enable 2FA for all owners and admins

### Project Structure

For larger teams, consider:
- One owner per project (clearer ownership)
- Multiple admins for redundancy
- Clear documentation of role responsibilities

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Received

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify the email address
3. Resend the invitation
4. Try a different email address

### Cannot Change Role

Possible causes:
- You're not an owner or admin
- You're trying to modify an owner (as admin)
- You're the last owner

### Cannot Remove Member

Possible causes:
- The member is the last owner
- You don't have sufficient permissions
