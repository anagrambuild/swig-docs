## Usage Tracking

### Paymaster Usage

## Overage Handling

### What Happens at Limit

When you reach your paymaster limit:

### Overage Billing

- Overage is billed at your tier's rate
- Invoice sent after usage is confirmed
- Payment required to continue service

### Limit Multiplier

After paying an overage invoice:
- Your limit is temporarily doubled
- This helps prevent service interruption
- Resets at the start of the next billing period
