## Overage Handling

### What Happens at Limit

When you reach your UserOps limit:

2. You're notified of the overage
3. An overage invoice is generated

### Overage Rates

| Tier | Rate per 1,000 UserOps |
|------|------------------------|
| PRO | $2.50 |
| ULTRA | $2.25 |
| ENTERPRISE | From $2.00 |

### Limit Multiplier

After paying an overage invoice:
- Your limit is temporarily increased
- This helps prevent service interruption
- Resets at the start of the next billing period

## Usage Notifications

Swig sends notifications at key usage thresholds:

| Threshold | Notification |
|-----------|--------------|
| 50% | Info - Halfway to limit |
| 75% | Warning - Approaching limit |
| 90% | Alert - Near limit |

| 100% | Limit reached |

Configure notifications in your organization settings.
