Paymasters enable gasless transactions by sponsoring transaction fees on behalf of your users. This creates a seamless user experience where users don't need SOL to interact with your application.

## What is a Paymaster?

A paymaster is a Solana wallet managed by Swig that:
- **Holds SOL** for sponsoring transaction fees
- **Signs transactions** as the fee payer
- **Tracks usage** for billing and limits
- **Enforces limits** to prevent abuse

When a user submits a transaction through your application, the paymaster covers the transaction fee, allowing users to transact without holding SOL.

## How It Works

```
User creates transaction
        ↓
Your app sends to Swig Paymaster
        ↓
Paymaster signs as fee payer
        ↓
Transaction submitted to Solana
        ↓
User's action succeeds (gasless!)
```

## Subscription Requirements

Paymasters are available on **paid tiers only**:

| Tier | Paymaster Access | Monthly Limit | Fee Rate |
|------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| FREE | No | - | - |
| PRO | Yes | $10,000 | 8% |
| ULTRA | Yes | $20,000 | 7% |
| ENTERPRISE | Yes | Custom | 6% |

<Warning>
  FREE tier accounts cannot create paymasters. Upgrade to PRO or higher to access paymaster features.
</Warning>

## Key Concepts

### Paymaster Limits

Each paymaster has configurable limits:

| Limit | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Usage API Threshold** | Max API calls per month | 1,000 |
| **SOL Usage Threshold** | Max SOL to spend per month | 10 SOL |
| **Single TX Limit** | Max SOL per transaction | 0.1 SOL |

### Monthly Limits

Your subscription tier determines your monthly sponsorship limit:
- Measured in USD value
- Resets at the start of each billing period
- Overage billing applies if exceeded

### Paymaster Balance

Each paymaster needs SOL to sponsor transactions:
- Fund the paymaster after creation
- Monitor balance to prevent failed transactions
- Low balance alerts available for Enterprise

## Use Cases

### User Onboarding

Remove friction for new users:
- Users don't need to acquire SOL first
- Immediate access to your application
- Higher conversion rates

### In-App Transactions

Seamless in-app experiences:
- Token transfers
- NFT minting
- DeFi interactions
- Game actions

### Subscription Services

Automate recurring transactions:
- Payment processing
- Subscription renewals
- Scheduled operations

## Paymaster vs Direct SDK

| Fee Payer | Paymaster wallet | User's wallet |
| User needs SOL | No | Yes |
| Usage tracking | Automatic | Manual |
| Billing | Included | N/A |
| Setup | Portal configuration | Code configuration |
| Best for | Production apps | Development/testing |

## Security

### Access Control

- Paymasters are scoped to your organization
- API keys authenticate requests
- Per-paymaster limits prevent abuse

### Allow Other Instructions

By default, paymasters only sponsor Swig-related instructions. You can enable `allowOtherIxs` to sponsor any instruction, but use caution:

<Warning>
  Enabling `allowOtherIxs` allows sponsoring any transaction type. This increases flexibility but also potential for abuse.
</Warning>

### Monitoring

- Track all sponsored transactions
- View real-time usage metrics
- Set up alerts for anomalies

## Best Practices

### Start with Limits

Begin with conservative limits:
- Low single transaction limit
- Moderate monthly threshold
- Increase as you understand usage patterns

### Monitor Usage

Regularly review:
- Transaction volume
- SOL spending
- Error rates

### Maintain Balance

Keep paymaster funded:
- Monitor balance regularly
- Set up low balance alerts (Enterprise)
- Automate top-ups if possible

### Separate Environments

Use different paymasters for:
- Development (devnet)
- Staging
- Production (mainnet)
