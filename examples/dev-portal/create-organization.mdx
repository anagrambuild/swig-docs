This guide walks you through creating a new organization in the Swig Developer Portal.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an organization, ensure you have:

- A Swig account at [dashboard.onswig.com](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
- A **verified email address** (required for organization creation)

<Warning>
  You must verify your email before creating organizations. Check your inbox for the verification link.
</Warning>

## Automatic Organization

When you first sign up for Swig, an organization is automatically created for you with:

- **You as the Owner** - Full control over the organization
- **FREE subscription** - Access to basic features
- **1 API key slot** - For programmatic access
- **1 team seat** - Just you to start

You can start using this organization immediately or create additional organizations for different projects.

1. Log in to the [Developer Portal](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
2. Click on your organization name in the sidebar

### Step 3: What Gets Created

When you create an organization, the system automatically:
