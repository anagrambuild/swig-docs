- **Balance** - Current SOL balance
- **Status** - Active or closed
- **Network** - Mainnet or devnet
- **Actions** - Edit, view, delete

### Paymaster Details

## Editing Settings

### Accessing Edit

2. Click **Edit** or the settings icon
3. Modify the settings
4. Click **Save**

### Editable Settings

#### Label

Update the display name:
- Descriptive and clear
- Maximum 64 characters
- Example: `production-mainnet-v2`

#### Usage API Threshold

Adjust API call limits:
- Increase for higher usage
- Decrease to reduce exposure
- Minimum: 1

#### SOL Usage Threshold

Modify monthly SOL spending limit:
- Set based on expected usage
- Consider adding buffer
- Minimum: 0.000000001 SOL

#### Single TX Limit

Change per-transaction limit:
- Balance security vs. functionality
- Higher for DeFi operations
- Lower for simple transfers

#### Allow Other Instructions

Toggle non-Swig instruction sponsorship:
- `false` - Only Swig instructions (recommended)
- `true` - Any instruction (use carefully)

## Monitoring Balance

### Current Balance

View the paymaster's SOL balance:
- Displayed in SOL
- Updates from blockchain
- Refresh to get latest

### Balance Alerts

For Enterprise accounts:
1. Set a low balance threshold
2. Configure alert recipients
3. Receive notifications when balance drops

### Funding

When balance is low:
1. Copy the paymaster address
2. Send SOL from any wallet
3. Balance updates after confirmation

## Usage Monitoring

### Current Period Usage

View usage for the current billing period:
- API calls made
- SOL spent
- USD value sponsored
- Transactions count

### Usage Limits

Track progress toward limits:
- Progress bars show percentage used
- Warnings at 80% and 90%
- Critical at 100%

### Usage Reset

Usage resets at the start of each billing period:
- Monthly reset
- Counters go back to zero
- Limits restored

## Limit Management

### Understanding Limits

| Limit Type | Scope | Reset |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Usage API Threshold | Per paymaster | Monthly |
| SOL Usage Threshold | Per paymaster | Monthly |
| Single TX Limit | Per transaction | N/A |
| Subscription Limit | Per organization | Monthly |

### Adjusting Limits

When to increase limits:
- Legitimate usage growth
- New product launch
- Seasonal traffic increase

When to decrease limits:
- Security concern
- Cost control
- Usage normalization

### Limit Hierarchy

Transactions are checked against:
1. Single TX limit (per paymaster)
2. SOL usage threshold (per paymaster)
3. Subscription limit (organization-wide)

## Closing a Paymaster

### When to Close

- No longer needed
- Consolidating paymasters
- Environment cleanup

### Close Process

1. Find the paymaster in the list
2. Click **Close** or the close icon
3. Enter a destination address for remaining funds
4. Confirm the closure

### What Happens

- Paymaster marked as deleted
- Remaining SOL transferred to destination
- Transaction history preserved
- Cannot be reactivated

<Warning>
  Closing a paymaster is permanent. Make sure to update any applications using it before closing.
</Warning>

## Deleting a Paymaster

### Permanent Deletion

After closing, you can permanently delete:
1. Find the closed paymaster
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deletion is irreversible. Transaction history may be lost.
</Warning>

## Network Selection

### Switching Networks

View paymasters by network:
1. Click the **Network Toggle**
2. Select **Mainnet** or **Devnet**
3. View paymasters for that network

### Network-Specific Paymasters

Create separate paymasters for:
- **Devnet** - Testing and development
- **Mainnet** - Production applications

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- Check balances weekly (or daily for high-volume)
- Review usage trends
- Identify anomalies early

### Conservative Limits

Start with conservative limits:
- Easier to increase than decrease
- Limits exposure if issues occur
- Adjust based on data

### Documentation

Keep records of:
- Paymaster purpose
- Expected usage
- Configuration rationale

### Alerting

Set up alerts for:
- Low balance (Enterprise)
- High usage
- Failed transactions

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Failures

If transactions fail:
1. Check paymaster balance
2. Verify limits aren't exceeded
3. Confirm paymaster is active
4. Check transaction details in history

### Balance Not Updating

If balance doesn't update:
1. Wait for blockchain confirmation
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if transfer succeeded on explorer

### Cannot Edit Paymaster

Possible causes:
- Paymaster is closed
- Insufficient permissions
- API error (try again)

## Enterprise Features

1. Set threshold (in lamports)
2. Add recipient emails
