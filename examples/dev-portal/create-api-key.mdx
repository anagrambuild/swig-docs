API keys authenticate your applications when making requests to Swig services. This guide walks you through creating an API key in the Developer Portal.

## What API Keys Are Used For

API keys are required for:

- Fetching policy details via the REST API
- Creating Swig wallets programmatically
- Accessing paymaster services for transaction sponsorship

## Prerequisites

Before creating an API key, ensure you have:

- A Swig account at [dashboard.onswig.com](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
- Access to an organization

## Creating an API Key

### Step 1: Navigate to API Keys

1. Log in to the [Developer Portal](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
2. Select your project from the sidebar
3. Click **API Keys** in the navigation menu

### Step 2: Create New Key

1. Click the **Create API Key** button
2. Enter a **name** for your key (required, 1-100 characters)
   - Use descriptive names like `production-backend` or `dev-testing`
3. Optionally set an **expiration date**
   - Leave empty for keys that never expire
4. Click **Create**

### Step 3: Copy Your Key

<Warning>
  **Important:** Your API key is only shown once. Copy it immediately and store it securely.
  You will not be able to view the full key again.
</Warning>

After creation, the portal displays your full API key. Copy it and store it in a secure location such as:

- Environment variables
- A secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Your CI/CD platform's secret storage

## API Key Format

Swig API keys follow this format:

```
sk_<64-hexadecimal-characters>
```

Example:
```
sk_a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

The `sk_` prefix identifies it as a Swig API key.

## Subscription Limits

API key limits depend on your subscription tier:

| Tier | API Keys Allowed |
|------|------------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Paid | Unlimited |

<Tip>
  Need more API keys? Upgrade your subscription in the portal's billing section.
</Tip>

## Using Your API Key

### In HTTP Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://dashboard.onswig.com/api/v1/policies/{policyId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_api_key"
```

### With the SDK

Pass your API key when initializing the client:

```typescript
import { SwigApiClient } from '@swig-wallet/api';

const client = new SwigApiClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SWIG_API_KEY,
  portalUrl: 'https://dashboard.onswig.com',
});
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** to store keys in your application
- **Rotate keys periodically**, especially if you suspect compromise
- **Use separate keys** for development and production environments

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names that indicate:
- The environment (`dev-`, `staging-`, `prod-`)
- The service or application using the key
- The purpose (`backend-api`, `mobile-app`, `testing`)

Examples:
- `prod-backend-service`
- `dev-local-testing`
- `staging-mobile-app`

### Expiration

Consider setting expiration dates for:
- Temporary access (contractors, testing)
- Compliance requirements
- Regular rotation schedules

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Keys

The API Keys page shows all your keys with:
- Name
- Creation date
- Expiration date (if set)
- Usage count
- Last used timestamp

### Deleting Keys

To revoke an API key:
1. Find the key in the API Keys table
2. Click the **Delete** action
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting an API key immediately invalidates it. Any applications using that key will lose access.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Now that you have an API key, you can:
- [Create a policy](./create-policy) to define wallet permissions
- [Fetch policies](./fetch-policy) programmatically
- [Create Swig wallets](./create-swig) via the API
