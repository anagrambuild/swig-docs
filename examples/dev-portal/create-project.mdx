This guide walks you through creating a new project in the Swig Developer Portal.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a project, ensure you have:

- A Swig account at [dashboard.onswig.com](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
- A **verified email address** (required for project creation)

<Warning>
  You must verify your email before creating projects. Check your inbox for the verification link.
</Warning>

## Automatic Project

When you first sign up for Swig, a project is automatically created for you with:

- **You as the Owner** - Full control over the project
- **FREE subscription** - Access to basic features
- **1 API key slot** - For programmatic access
- **1 team seat** - Just you to start

You can start using this project immediately or create additional projects for different applications.
