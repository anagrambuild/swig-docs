Policies define how Swig wallets are created and what permissions they have. This guide explains the concepts behind policies and walks you through creating one in the Developer Portal.

## Understanding Policies

A **Policy** combines two key components:

- **Signer**: The cryptographic identity (authority) that controls the wallet
- **Permission**: The set of allowed actions for that signer

```
Policy = Signer + Permission
```

When you create a Swig wallet using a policy, the wallet is initialized with the signer and permissions defined in that policy.

<Tip>
  Policies can be created without a signer. In this case, you must provide the signer information when creating a wallet via the API.
</Tip>

## Key Concepts

### Signers

A **Signer** represents a cryptographic authority that can sign transactions for the wallet. Each signer has:

- **Type**: The signature algorithm used
- **Public Key**: The cryptographic public key
- **Max Duration Slots** (for sessions): How long the authority remains valid

### Permissions

A **Permission** defines what actions a signer can perform. Permissions are composed of one or more **Actions** that specify allowed operations.

### Authority Types

Swig supports multiple authority types for different use cases:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `ED25519` | Standard Solana keypair | Most common, native Solana wallets |
| `ED25519_SESSION` | Time-limited Ed25519 | Temporary access, delegated signing |
| `SECP256K1` | Ethereum-compatible keys | Cross-chain, Ethereum wallet users |
| `SECP256K1_SESSION` | Time-limited Secp256k1 | Temporary Ethereum key access |
| `SECP256R1` | WebAuthn/Passkey compatible | Browser-based authentication |
| `SECP256R1_SESSION` | Time-limited Secp256r1 | Temporary passkey sessions |

### Action Types

Actions define what operations are permitted:

**General:**
- `All` - Full access to all operations
- `AllButManageAuthority` - Everything except adding/removing signers
- `ManageAuthority` - Can add and remove signers

**SOL Transfers:**
- `SolLimit` - Transfer up to a specified amount of SOL
- `SolRecurringLimit` - Transfer up to an amount within a time window
- `SolDestinationLimit` - Transfer to a specific destination only
- `SolRecurringDestinationLimit` - Recurring limit to specific destination

**Token Transfers:**
- `TokenLimit` - Transfer up to a specified amount of a token
- `TokenRecurringLimit` - Token transfer with time-based limits
- `TokenDestinationLimit` - Token transfer to specific destination
- `TokenRecurringDestinationLimit` - Recurring token limit to destination

**Program Access:**
- `Program` - Can interact with a specific program ID
- `ProgramAll` - Can interact with any program
- `ProgramCurated` - Can interact with curated/approved programs

**Staking:**
- `StakeLimit` - Stake up to a specified amount
- `StakeRecurringLimit` - Staking with time-based limits
- `StakeAll` - Full staking permissions

**Sub-accounts:**
- `SubAccount` - Can manage sub-accounts

## Creating a Policy

### Step 1: Navigate to Policies

1. Log in to the [Developer Portal](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Policies** in the navigation menu

### Step 2: Start Policy Creation

Click the **Create Policy** button to open the policy creation dialog.

### Step 3: Select or Create a Permission

The first step asks you to choose permissions:

**Option A: Use an Existing Permission**
- Search and select from your previously created permissions
- Useful for reusing permission sets across multiple policies

**Option B: Start from a Template**
- **Blank**: Start with no actions (add your own)
- **Full Access**: Includes the `All` action
- Other templates may be available

**Option C: Create a New Permission**
- Configure custom actions for this policy
- The permission is saved and can be reused later

### Step 4: Configure the Policy

Fill in the policy details:

#### Basic Information
- **Policy Name** (required): A descriptive name, e.g., `user-wallet-policy`
- **Description** (optional): Explain the policy's purpose

#### Signer Configuration

Choose one of three options:

**Link Existing Signer:**
- Select from signers you've previously created
- Useful for reusing the same authority across policies

**Create New Signer:**
- **Signer Name**: Descriptive name for the signer
- **Type**: Select the authority type (Ed25519, Secp256k1, etc.)
- **Public Key**: The authority's public key
  - For Ed25519: Base58-encoded public key
  - For Secp256k1/Secp256r1: Hex-encoded (64 bytes)
- **Max Duration Slots** (session types only): How long the session is valid

**Skip for Now:**
- Create the policy without a signer
- You must provide the signer when creating wallets via the API

#### Permission Configuration

If you didn't select an existing permission:
- Use the **Permissions Builder** to add actions
- Configure limits and destinations as needed
- At least one action is required

### Step 5: Create the Policy

Review your configuration and click **Create Policy**.

## Policy Status

Policies have different statuses based on their configuration:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Complete** | Has both signer and permission |
| **Missing Signer** | Has permission but no signer attached |
| **Missing Permission** | Has signer but no permission (rare) |
| **Incomplete** | Missing both signer and permission |

<Tip>
  Policies with "Missing Signer" status can still be used. Provide the signer information when creating a wallet via the API's `signerId` parameter.
</Tip>

## Example: Creating a Limited Transfer Policy

Here's an example of creating a policy that allows limited SOL transfers:

1. **Policy Name**: `limited-sol-transfer`
2. **Description**: `Allows up to 1 SOL transfers per day`
3. **Signer**:
   - Type: `ED25519`
   - Public Key: Your user's Solana public key
4. **Permission Actions**:
   - `SolRecurringLimit`:
     - Amount: `1000000000` (1 SOL in lamports)
     - Window: `86400` (24 hours in seconds)

This policy creates wallets where the signer can transfer up to 1 SOL per day.

## Managing Policies

### Viewing Policies

The Policies page shows:
- Policy name and description
- Attached signer (if any)
- Permission summary
- Status indicator
- Last updated timestamp

### Updating Policies

Click on a policy to:
- Change the name or description
- Attach a different signer
- Update the permission

### Deleting Policies

<Warning>
  Deleting a policy does not affect wallets already created with it. Existing wallets retain their original configuration.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a policy, you can:
- [Fetch the policy](./fetch-policy) via the API to verify its configuration
- [Create Swig wallets](./create-swig) using your policy
