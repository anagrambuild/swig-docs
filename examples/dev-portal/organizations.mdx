Organizations are the foundation of your Swig Developer Portal experience. They serve as containers for your projects, team members, API keys, policies, and paymasters.

## What is an Organization?

An organization in Swig represents a project or company that uses the Swig protocol. Each organization has:

- **Members** with different roles and permissions
- **A subscription** that determines available features
- **API keys** for programmatic access
- **Policies** defining wallet permissions
- **Paymasters** for transaction sponsorship

## Key Features

### Team Collaboration

Organizations support multiple members with role-based access control:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access to everything, including billing and ownership transfer |
| **Admin** | Can manage members and most settings |
| **Member** | Standard access to project resources |
| **Billing** | Access to billing and subscription management only |

### Subscription Tiers

Each organization has a subscription that determines available features:

| Feature | FREE | PRO | ULTRA | ENTERPRISE |
|---------|------|-----|-------|------------|
| API Keys | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Paymaster Access | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Paymaster Limit | - | $10k/mo | $20k/mo | Custom |

## Best Practices

### Organization Naming

Choose a clear, descriptive name for your organization:
- Use your company or project name
- Keep it recognizable for team members
- Avoid special characters

### Role Assignment

Follow the principle of least privilege:
- Give **Owner** role only to key decision-makers
- Use **Admin** for team leads who need member management
- Assign **Member** role for developers
- Use **Billing** for finance team members who only need billing access

### Multiple Organizations

You can be a member of multiple organizations:
- Use separate organizations for different projects
- Keep production and development environments separate
- Maintain clear boundaries between client projects

## Next Steps

- [Create an organization](./create-organization) for your project

- [Choose a subscription](./subscriptions-billing) that fits your needs
