The Swig Developer Portal is your central hub for managing API access, policies, and wallet creation. Whether you're building a dApp, integrating Swig wallets, or setting up transaction sponsorship, the portal provides the tools you need.

## What You Can Do

The Developer Portal enables you to:

- **Create and manage API keys** for authenticated access to Swig services
- **Define policies** that combine signers and permissions for wallet creation
- **Create Swig wallets** programmatically using your configured policies
- **Monitor usage** and manage your organization's resources

## Getting Started

Before using the Developer Portal features, you'll need:

1. A Swig account at [dashboard.onswig.com](https://dashboard.onswig.com)
2. An organization (created automatically on signup)

## SDK Installation

To interact with the Developer Portal programmatically, install the Swig API package:

```bash
npm install @swig-wallet/api
# or
bun add @swig-wallet/api
```

Then initialize the client:

```typescript
import { SwigApiClient } from '@swig-wallet/api';

const client = new SwigApiClient({
  apiKey: 'sk_your_api_key',
  portalUrl: 'https://dashboard.onswig.com',
});
```

## Next Steps

Start by [creating an API key](./create-api-key) to access the Swig API programmatically.
