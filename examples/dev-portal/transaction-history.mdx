   - Limit exceeded
   - Network congestion
   - Invalid transaction

### Missing Transactions

If a transaction doesn't appear:
1. Wait for blockchain confirmation
2. Refresh the page
3. Check the correct network (mainnet/devnet)
4. Verify the transaction was sent to this paymaster

### Duplicate Transactions

If you see duplicates:
1. Check transaction signatures (should be different)
2. Could be legitimate retries
3. Contact support if unexpected

## Analytics Best Practices

### Regular Review

- Daily: Check for anomalies
- Weekly: Review usage trends
- Monthly: Analyze cost and volume

### Alerting

Set up alerts for:
- Unusual transaction volume
- High failure rates
- Budget thresholds

### Budgeting

Use historical data to:
- Forecast future costs
- Plan capacity
- Set appropriate limits

## Integration with Billing

### Cost Attribution

Transaction history links to billing:
- Each transaction counted toward limits
- USD value affects subscription usage
- Overage triggers tracked

### Invoice Details

View transactions related to invoices:
- Which transactions incurred costs
- Breakdown by period
- Cost per paymaster

## API Access

### Programmatic Access

Query transaction history via API:

```typescript
import { SwigApiClient } from '@swig-wallet/api';

const client = new SwigApiClient({
  apiKey: 'sk_your_api_key',
  portalUrl: 'https://dashboard.onswig.com',
});

// Transaction history is primarily accessed via the Dashboard
// For real-time monitoring, use webhook integrations (Enterprise)
```

### Webhook Integration (Enterprise)

Enterprise accounts can configure:
- Transaction webhooks
- Real-time notifications
- Custom integrations

## Next Steps

- [Manage paymaster settings](./manage-paymaster) to adjust limits
- [Create additional paymasters](./create-paymaster) for different use cases
- [Review billing](./subscriptions-billing) based on usage data
