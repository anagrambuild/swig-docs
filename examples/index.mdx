# SWIG Examples

SWIG provides a variety of examples to help developers understand and implement SWIG in different scenarios. Whether you're building a new dApp from scratch or integrating SWIG into an existing application, we have examples to guide you through the process.

## Example Categories

Our examples cover various use cases including:

- In-app wallet integration
- Legacy dApp integration
- SWIG-native dApp development
- CLI applications
- Subscription-based applications (like SwigFlix)
- Wallet Standard integration

## Finding More Examples

We maintain an ever-growing collection of examples in our [awesome-swig repository](https://github.com/anagrambuild/awesome-swig). This community-driven resource includes:

- Complete application examples
- SDK usage demonstrations (both Rust and TypeScript)
- Integration patterns
- CLI tools and utilities

The awesome-swig repository is regularly updated with new examples and best practices from the SWIG community. We encourage developers to explore these examples and contribute their own implementations to help others learn and build with SWIG.

Remember that these examples are meant to serve as starting points and can be adapted to fit your specific needs.
