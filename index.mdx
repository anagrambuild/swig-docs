# Introduction to Swig

Swig is revolutionizing the way developers build and users interact with wallets on Solana. As a comprehensive smart wallet framework, Swig enables powerful features that were previously difficult or impossible to implement on Solana.

## What is Swig?

Swig is an account abstraction toolkit that empowers developers to create sophisticated, programmable Solana smart wallets. Built inside a Solana program, a Swig wallet is an on-chain account that can perform all standard wallet functions while adding powerful programmable features:

- **Non-Custodial Smart Wallets**: Create embedded wallets with no intermediaries, allowing developers to request permissions without managing keys
- **Granular Permissions**: Delegate specific transaction permissions rather than full wallet control
- **Session Keys**: Enable temporary, permissioned access for applications without constant manual approvals
- **Automated Transactions**: Power subscription payments, payment streaming, and conditional transactions
- **Social Recovery**: Manage wallets using social accounts like Google, X, or Facebook through zero-knowledge proofs
- **Chain Abstraction**: Operate seamlessly across multiple SVM chains
- **Paymaster Integration**: Cover gas fees for users through a central account

## Why Swig Matters

Smart wallets have become essential infrastructure for modern blockchain applications, offering features like automated transactions, multi-signature support, and delegated spending limits. While smart wallets have seen wide adoption on Ethereum, Solana has remained underserved - until now.

Swig addresses this gap by providing:

1. **Payment Infrastructure**: As Solana emerges as a leader in payments, Swig enables powerful non-custodial payment solutions for both consumers and businesses
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Smart wallet capabilities dramatically improve UX, critical for Solana's consumer applications
3. **Performance at Scale**: Swig's optimized design maintains Solana's high speed and low fees, even with advanced wallet features

## How Swig Works

The Swig protocol operates through a role-based system that enables seamless interaction with various services and platforms on Solana. Each role has:

- An authority mechanism that can include social logins, blockchain keypairs, and other authentication methods
- A set of configurable permissions that control what actions can be taken
- Optional session-based authentication for enhanced security

This flexible architecture allows developers to create custom wallet solutions while maintaining security and user control. Whether you're building DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, or next-generation consumer wallets, Swig provides the infrastructure needed to create powerful, user-friendly experiences.
