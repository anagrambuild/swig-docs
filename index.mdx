## **What is Swig?**

Swig is an account abstraction toolkit that empowers developers to create sophisticated, programmable smart wallets on Solana. It‚Äôs powerful, open-sourced, and fast to build on - most use cases can be built on Swig in \<30 minutes.

Smart wallet functionality has been popular on EVM chains, but less developed on Solana. Swig changes that. Developers can now build smarter on Solana with Swig. See how below.

### **Current Market Problems**

Developments in Web3 have brought many benefits, but simultaneously some table stakes Web2 functions have been lost along the way. Traditional crypto wallets are part of this problem:

- **Poor UX:** Traditional wallets force users to either give up full control or do everything manually themselves. You could be the best dev, but your app‚Äôs experience would inherently be downgraded as a result.
- **Payments:** While crypto solves many payments challenges, the automated and configurable transaction tooling critical for most payments use cases is still limited.
- **General Abstraction:** Developers need to rely on users who are blockchain experts to gain traction on their apps due to limited abstraction tooling in the market.
- **Onboarding:** Seed phrases, onramps, and gas all make onboarding to a new app complicated. Devs are losing the battle before it even starts.

Smart wallets solve these problems, but while smart wallets have seen widespread adoption on Ethereum, Solana has remained underserved - until now.

### **How Swig Solves These Problems**

A Swig wallet is an on-chain account built inside a Solana program that can perform all standard wallet functions while adding powerful programmable features:

## **Why Swig Makes Solana More Powerful**

Solana combined with Swig is a game changer for developers.

|                             | Solana                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Solana \+ Swig                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payments Infrastructure** | Solana is emerging as a leader in payments due in large part to its fast transaction settlement speed                                                                                                                                                                | Swig expands on this by allowing developers to **abstract complexity** and create **powerful non-custodial payments solutions** for consumers and businesses |
| **Consumer Adoption**       | Solana is the hub for consumer apps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Swig **dramatically improves UX** for Solana app developers by enhancing key management systems to enable **simple and secure product flows**                |
| **Performance at Scale**    | Solana‚Äôs fast transaction speeds and low fees make it particularly attractive for high-velocity trading and payment use cases But, legacy wallet experiences limit this performance advantage with constant manual approvals and limited transaction programmability | Swig‚Äôs optimized design **maintains Solana‚Äôs high speed and low fees**, even with advanced wallet features                                                   |

## **How Swig Works**

The Swig protocol operates through a role-based system that enables seamless interaction with various services and platforms on Solana. Each role has:

- An authority mechanism that can include social logins, blockchain keypairs, and other authentication methods
- A set of configurable permissions that control what actions can be taken
- Optional session-based authentication for enhanced security

This flexible architecture allows developers to create custom wallet solutions while maintaining security and user control. Whether you‚Äôre building DeFi apps, payment solutions, or next-generation consumer wallets, Swig provides the infrastructure needed to create powerful, user-friendly experiences.
